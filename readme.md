# Coffee

Coffee (aka readCoffee) is a web platform for curating, recommending, and discovering online stories and articles in a pleasant way that fits your workflow!

In this particular repository lives a slackbot developed for teams using Slack to quietly recommend articles to their peers and co-workers. Slack is often used for article recommendation, but links get lost pretty easily. Instead of searching and scrolling back, why not get prompted a list of articles whenever you need it?

Coffee:bot is the first of many parts of our project to make article recommendation much more pleasant than it currently is. We are utilizing Howdy's Botkit as our base to develop a userbot with whom any member of your slack team can interact. Coffee:bot is still under development, however once we're ready for you, just add @coffee to your team and say "hi"! :)
